# Sensor contract and replay

`rustdrive-pipeline` exposes `PipelineConfig`, `SensorFrame`, `DrivingPipeline` and `PipelineOutput`. Both reference simulation and RNE call the same stateful synchronous library. No executor or middleware is needed.

## Input boundary

Configuration supplies a validated arc-length route, calibrated initial pose, vehicle geometry/limits, nominal time step and cruise speed. The observed frame contains:

- `time`: finite, nonnegative, strictly increasing seconds on one simulation clock.
- `odometry`: optional acquisition-stamped speed and yaw rate; required at 20 Hz.
- `gnss`: optional acquisition-stamped noisy position/variance; generated at 5 Hz.
- `lidar`: optional acquisition-stamped **body-frame** x-forward/y-left returns; generated at 10 Hz.
- `lidar_failed`: explicit acquisition failure (default false), distinct from healthy zero returns.

Absent samples do not refresh last accepted timestamps. Duplicate, out-of-order, future and invalid samples cannot refresh them either. Odometry older than 0.15 s, LiDAR older than 0.35 s or accepted GNSS older than 0.75 s brakes. Clock gaps over 0.25 s and excessive localization uncertainty brake. Regressing/non-finite clocks return an error before state mutation; adapters must stop on errors. This research health policy is intentionally conservative and does not support GNSS-denied navigation.

Ground-truth poses, object identities and physical collision results are not input fields. Unknown top-level fields are rejected. Synthetic sensors necessarily observe the simulator world; their noisy measurements cross this boundary.

## Log schema 1

`sensors.jsonl` is separate from the evaluation/display `run.json`. It contains one JSON object per line:

1. `{"kind":"header","header":{"schema_version":1,"source":"...","config":...}}`
2. One or more `{"kind":"tick","tick":{"input":...,"expected":...}}` records.
3. Mandatory `{"kind":"end","ticks":N}` count footer.

The expected record contains the complete estimate, tracks, forecasts, trajectory, command, emergency state, health and position variance. It never enters the pipeline. Replay constructs fresh state from the header, feeds only inputs, and compares reserialized outputs exactly. Serde's float-roundtrip parsing preserves recorded f64 values. No tolerance or success shortcut hides differences.

```sh
cargo run --release --locked --bin rustdrive -- replay \
  --log artifacts/demo/sensors.jsonl --output artifacts/replay
```

Exit 0 means every tick matched and the count footer completed. Exit 2 means a mismatch, schema/input/clock error, empty/truncated log, extra data, or I/O failure. The reader limits each line to 8 MiB. It streams outputs and propagates flush errors. A previous `replay.json` is removed before reading the log; a new success report is written only after verification completes. `outputs.jsonl` may contain a partial prefix after failure and must not be interpreted as a verified run.

## Evidence and limits

Unit/integration tests check actual recomputation, changed commands, empty/truncated/dropped tick streams, schema/version/truth-field rejection and failing output writers. CLI tests verify exit 2 and removal of a stale success report for corrupted and missing input. Reference and RNE-generated logs are verified end to end.

Exact repeatability is tested on this Linux build/platform. The locally recorded RNE Rust 1.95.0 dynamic log also verified with the Rust 1.90.0 default CLI; general cross-platform/toolchain bitwise reproducibility is not established. Schema changes require a future migration/version decision.

Replay verifies deterministic computation, **not** collision avoidance, goal completion or real-time execution. An incomplete or colliding physical run can have a fully reproducible log. Physical acceptance is scored independently in `summary.json`; sensor logs intentionally contain no truth evaluator inputs.
